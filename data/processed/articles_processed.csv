Why Educating Cleaning Associates is Essential for Promoting Building Health

Maintaining a clean, healthy environment requires more than just surface-level cleaning – it demands empowered, properly trained associates who take pride in their work. Ensuring associates understand the science and the rationale behind their tasks is important not only for quality service, but also truly sanitized spaces.
With the right knowledge and tools, cleaning associates have the confidence that they are the experts, providing a greater level of care and comfort for building occupants.

Chemical Education
Considering how often associates work with various cleaning products, it is essential team members are educated on the science behind the chemical agents they are using, what makes them effective and how to properly use them.
For example:

A chlorine bleach-based product, like toilet bowl cleaner, can erode the finish of a sink due to its corrosive properties.
Floors often do not respond well to general cleaners or most disinfectants, which can result in a sticky residue. Use a neutral floor cleaner.

By educating associates on these nuances, we empower them to achieve superior results while protecting the integrity of the spaces they clean.
Mastering Dwell Times
Dwell times - the period a disinfectant needs to remain on a surface to eliminate bacteria or viruses – is a fundamental of proper cleaning. They can vary depending on how each disinfectant interacts with various bacteria or viruses.
Associates need to know whether the dwell time is 30 seconds, two minutes or 10 minutes to ensure the product is used correctly.
With this knowledge, they’ll be more effective and the areas they clean will be healthier.
Understanding Germ Loads
Creating sanitary environments relies upon cleaning associates understanding where germs and bacteria loads are likely to be high. 
While associates are typically trained to clean door handles, light switches and toilet seats, challenging your teams’ critical thinking can elevate their approach.
For example:

Commonly touched surfaces like refrigerator door, coffee pot and microwave handles often require additional attention.
Shared areas that are frequently used but hastily cleaned, like privacy booths.

Using the Right Tools
Doing manual tasks not only takes more time but increases the risk of injury.
Honor investments, boost efficiency and promote safety by taking inventory of the equipment you have available and ensuring that it is being properly maintained and utilized. For example:

Is a restroom cleaning machine collecting dust because it’s not easily accessible?
Are associates bypassing intelligent mops for hand mops because they don’t know how to use them properly?

When associates are empowered to utilize modern tools effectively, they not only save time but also work more safely and efficiently.
Microfiber: Small But Mighty
One of the best tools in a cleaning arsenal is microfiber. Many associates default to rags or disposables because the benefits of microfiber are not clearly explained.
Microfiber cloths are made of synthetic fibers—typically polyester and nylon—that are split into tiny strands, each about 1/100th the diameter of a human hair. This creates a massive surface area for trapping dirt, dust and bacteria.

Microfiber can remove 99% of bacteria and germs using just water.
Microfiber creates a static charge that attracts and traps particles, preventing them from being spread around.

Tip: Increase microfiber longevity by following the manufacturer's recommendations for laundering.
In conclusion, a well-trained cleaning team is crucial to maintaining spaces that are not only clean but also truly healthy and safe. By educating associates about chemical agents they are using, dwell times, germ loads, and the importance of using the right tools, we can help build employee confidence while enhancing building health.

Post pandemic, companies and organizations are increasingly challenged to address mental health in the workplace. It’s clear employees value occupations that align with their mental health needs and overall well-being. Employers that embrace this will see benefits themselves; improving employee mental health—which encompasses stress, sleep quality, mood, fatigue, well-being, depression, burnout, productivity, concentration, and engagement—has been shown to reduce healthcare costs and absenteeism while increasing productivity. Of course, the foundation of a happy, healthy workplace is culture. (In fact, studies have shown that a manager impacts a worker’s mental health more than a doctor or therapist does.) To improve culture, companies are now prioritizing employee well-being programs, holistic health benefits, and open conversations about mental health. And whereas programs are vital, a workplace’s physical environment can also influence mental health. As such, facility managers have a unique opportunity to support employee mental health through the design and management of the physical office space, as follows:
Layout
For concentration and productivity, private offices are preferred over open floorplans (Kropman et al.)—but we all know this isn’t feasible for most settings. To optimize open offices, limit desk clusters to 2–5 people and be sure to implement a visual and/or acoustic separation between each cluster. Visual separation doesn’t have to be limited to cubicles. Variations in flooring—whether it be a different material, pattern, or color—can be used to visually designate one zone from another.
Offices that offer breakout rooms or spaces tend to reap the benefits of improved employee well-being, concentration, and productivity (Kropman et al.). These separate spaces empower employees with flexibility in how they work, serving as a place where they are encouraged to collaborate loudly with others or where they can find peace during a stressful day.

Aesthetics
Colors and textures are easy ways to dictate the mood of a given space. In breakrooms, dark or neutral colors add a coziness that can help employees relax. In work areas, whites and blues are your best bet for increased productivity and reduced stress (Kropman et al.).
If the idea of a white-walled work area sounds stark, consider using the floor as a way to bring in subtle bursts of color and texture. Carpet tiles with variations in pile height can usher in depth, interest, and texture without distracting from worker productivity. In kitchens or vitality spaces, colorful rubber tiles can bring a sense of playfulness and serve as a visual break from the “work zone” whites and blues.
Acoustics
According to a 2018 study, good acoustics are a top priority for employees. Choosing the right furnishings helps mitigate excess noise and echoes, with floors playing an especially integral role in this. This is such an important topic that I dedicated a previous blog post to it. For more information, read “Addressing Acoustic Comfort for Increased Productivity and Comfort.”

Temperature
The thermostat is arguably one of the biggest points of conflict in any shared space. The ideal temperature range can vary based on the season and geographic location of a building, but 68–75º is usually a good starting point (Kropman et al.). Still, there’s always someone who’s too hot and someone else who’s too cold—it seems impossible to please everyone! So, when possible, providing employees with the ability to control the temperature in their individual space keeps everyone happy and focused.
Indoor Air Quality
“Stuffy” air has been shown to negatively impact employee productivity, concentration, and fatigue (Kropman et al.). Proper ventilation can be a breath of fresh air to employees’ well-being and performance. But air quality goes beyond the perception of stuffiness versus freshness—things like volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and allergens can have a very real impact on someone’s health. The U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Association estimates that poor air quality creates a combined loss of $15 billion annually for businesses due to worker inefficiency and sick days. Recent statistics from the Asthma & Allergy Foundation of America suggest that 27 million Americans suffer from asthma and another 100 million have allergies. Designing a space that reduces exposure to asthma and allergy triggers relies heavily on selecting the right materials from the get-go. When choosing a floorcovering, for example, facility managers should place careful evaluation on the materials, chemicals, and adhesives used in the product’s manufacturing, installation, and daily maintenance. I’ve written more on this topic previously; check out the blog post “How Climate Change Impacts Our Buildings and the People Inside—and Design Choices That Can Help” for more detailed information and guidance.

Light
Our circadian rhythms are heavily impacted by light. Employees who work in dark offices or with minimal exposure to natural light are likely to be fatigued and experience poorer sleep quality—which in turn result in reduced concentration and productivity (Kropman et al.). Darker days in the fall and winter can also lead to depression, with an estimated 10 million Americans experiencing seasonal affective disorder. Increasing exposure to natural light in the office—designing around windows, installing skylights or solar tubes, or at the very least offering access to artificial sunlight lamps—can boost moods and performance. At the same time, be sure to offer options for employees to block out excess light or glare when needed.
Lightbulbs are lower-hanging fruit. Selecting bulbs with the right brightness and relative temperature can work wonders in improving productivity, concentration, and fatigue. For optimal performance, select bright, cool-toned lights over dim, warm-toned lights. To go above and beyond, give employees the ability to control the lighting in their workspace, which can further improve well-being and engagement (Kropman et al.).
Nature
Views of nature have been shown to reduce fatigue and improve sleep quality, mood, productivity, and well-being. For offices that can’t guarantee forest views for everyone, bringing nature into the office can have significant effects on employee mental health too. Incorporating 1–3 plants per employee can increase productivity by 3–15%, increase concentration by 10–20%, and reduce stress by 4–8%. Just be sure not to get too carried away, as too many plants, which could be visually overwhelming, can backfire (Kropman et al.).
The average full-time worker spends nearly half of their waking time at work. The least we can do is ensure their office supports not only their performance but, more importantly, their mental health and overall well-being too.

Facility managers may know us for our biggest conference of the year: World Workplace. But for those in the built environment looking for a holistic learning experience intended to help practitioners become a more well-rounded facility manager, Facility Fusion is the perfect fit. This conference is packed with unique opportunities to enhance yourself and your community through doing what facility managers do best: making the environment around you a better place to live, work and play. 
Here’s five reasons facility managers can’t miss Facility Fusion 2025 in Austin, Texas: 
1. Network in person with facility managers from across the globe. 

Our membership is diverse and spans across multiple industries, communities and countries. See how healthcare FMs tackle modern-day challenges. Learn how FMs who manage airports incorporate innovative solutions. Study how FMs in education grow their facility knowledge. There’s endless possibilities to take adapt solutions from other facility experts into your own buildings. This year at Facility Fusion, IFMA has made sure there’s plenty of opportunities to meet new FMs and grow your network. Pop by the welcome reception, join the community service project or grab a drink at the coffee connect. Need a break to stretch your legs? Join us for our Fusion Wellness Activity. Don’t miss the IFMA Cares Community service project to help support the Austin Humane Society on April 30!
2. Take advantage of learning in person with education sessions that address modern-day challenges. 

At IFMA, we understand everyone learns differently. It’s important to us to have a wide range of courses and classes to make sure each FM's individual learning needs are met. If you thrive from learning in person, Facility Fusion is one of the best opportunities for you to access high-quality in-person educational sessions made specifically for modern-day facility managers. Every year, we curate our education sessions to address the latest emerging topics in our industry from the built environment’s most seasoned speakers. Get the most out of the in-person experience by joining a learning lab or collaborating at a hands-on workshop. Not only will you leave these sessions inspired with new ideas and solutions, but it's likely you will meet other facility professionals who can help you work through your most pressing facility challenges.  
3. Find solution experts that are the best fit for you and your team to work with. 

How many times have you finished an online demo with a potential new vendor and were left feeling unsure? The magic of IFMA’s expo is you can maximize your time by seeing all the top FM products in one place, and you experience in real-time what it would be like to work with that solution team. When you’re investing a large portion of your budget into a certain facility management solution, you can feel more confident about the purchase by vetting the providers in person and creating an organic rapport. Not only is hitting the expo floor more efficient than online demos, but the prizes, contests and freebies make the entire experience more fun.  
4. Listen and learn from power speakers in facility management. 

Everyone needs inspiration to go back to their facilities inspired and invigorated to tackle the job. We’ve hand-picked experts in psychology, communication, and leadership to help encourage you to think differently about how you tackle your day-to-day. These leading experts in their fields will expand your idea of how facility management is interconnected to our environment and how FMs can make a bigger impact in the world. Don’t miss the opportunity to think outside the box and improve your life, mind and holistic health with our power speaker sessions.  
5. Explore a behind-the-scenes tour of fascinating facilities in Austin, Texas

Join us for an exclusive experience to tour Austin City Library. This 40,000 sq. feet facility boasts many cutting-edge sustainable designs, achieving 40% greater energy efficiency than similarly sized buildings.
