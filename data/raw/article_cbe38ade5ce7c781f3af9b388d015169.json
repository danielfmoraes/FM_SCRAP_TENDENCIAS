But for those in the built environment looking for a holistic learning experience intended to help practitioners become a more well-rounded facility manager, Facility Fusion is the perfect fit. This conference is packed with unique opportunities to enhance yourself and your community through doing what facility managers do best: making the environment around you a better place to live, work and play. \nHere’s five reasons facility managers can’t miss Facility Fusion 2025 in Austin, Texas: \n1. Network in person with facility managers from across the globe. \n\nOur membership is diverse and spans across multiple industries, communities and countries. See how healthcare FMs tackle modern-day challenges. Learn how FMs who manage airports incorporate innovative solutions. Study how FMs in education grow their facility knowledge. There’s endless possibilities to take adapt solutions from other facility experts into your own buildings. This year at Facility Fusion, IFMA has made sure there’s plenty of opportunities to meet new FMs and grow your network. Pop by the welcome reception, join the community service project or grab a drink at the coffee connect. Need a break to stretch your legs? Join us for our Fusion Wellness Activity. Don’t miss the IFMA Cares Community service project to help support the Austin Humane Society on April 30!\n2. Take advantage of learning in person with education sessions that address modern-day challenges. \n\nAt IFMA, we understand everyone learns differently. It’s important to us to have a wide range of courses and classes to make sure each FM's individual learning needs are met. If you thrive from learning in person, Facility Fusion is one of the best opportunities for you to access high-quality in-person educational sessions made specifically for modern-day facility managers. Every year, we curate our education sessions to address the latest emerging topics in our industry from the built environment’s most seasoned speakers. Get the most out of the in-person experience by joining a learning lab or collaborating at a hands-on workshop. Not only will you leave these sessions inspired with new ideas and solutions, but it's likely you will meet other facility professionals who can help you work through your most pressing facility challenges.  \n3. Find solution experts that are the best fit for you and your team to work with. \n\nHow many times have you finished an online demo with a potential new vendor and were left feeling unsure? The magic of IFMA’s expo is you can maximize your time by seeing all the top FM products in one place, and you experience in real-time what it would be like to work with that solution team. When you’re investing a large portion of your budget into a certain facility management solution, you can feel more confident about the purchase by vetting the providers in person and creating an organic rapport. Not only is hitting the expo floor more efficient than online demos, but the prizes, contests and freebies make the entire experience more fun.  \n4. Listen and learn from power speakers in facility management. \n\nEveryone needs inspiration to go back to their facilities inspired and invigorated to tackle the job. We’ve hand-picked experts in psychology, communication, and leadership to help encourage you to think differently about how you tackle your day-to-day. These leading experts in their fields will expand your idea of how facility management is interconnected to our environment and how FMs can make a bigger impact in the world. Don’t miss the opportunity to think outside the box and improve your life, mind and holistic health with our power speaker sessions.  \n5. Explore a behind-the-scenes tour of fascinating facilities in Austin, Texas\n\nJoin us for an exclusive experience to tour Austin City Library. This 40,000 sq. feet facility boasts many cutting-edge sustainable designs, achieving 40% greater energy efficiency than similarly sized buildings.
